OpenHive is designed for a **"Source-to-Cloud"** workflow. You focus on the code, and we handle the containerization, scaling, and networking.

## OpenHive Cloud

The easiest way to deploy is to use our managed serverless platform.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Authenticate
    Ensure your CLI is linked to your account.
    
    ```bash
    hive login
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Configure Metadata
    Open your `.agent-card.json` and ensure the version number is correct. OpenHive uses **Immutable Versioning**—you cannot overwrite a version once published.

    ```json
    {
      "name": "my-agent",
      "version": "1.0.1" 
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Deploy
    Run the publish command.

    ```bash
    hive publish
    ```

    **What happens behind the scenes:**
    1.  **Build**: We detect your runtime (Node/Python) and build an optimized OCI container.
    2.  **Registry**: We update the global registry with your agent's new version and capabilities.
    3.  **Provisioning**: We spin up a Firecracker microVM in the nearest region.
    4.  **Routing**: We assign a public endpoint (`https://www.openhive.cloud/api/agent/...`) and route traffic to your instance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

You can automate deployments using GitHub Actions.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/deploy.yml"
name: Deploy Agent

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      
      - name: Install CLI
        run: npm install -g @open-hive/cli
        
      - name: Publish
        run: hive publish
        env:
          HIVE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.HIVE_API_KEY }}
```
