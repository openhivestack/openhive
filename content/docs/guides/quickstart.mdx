This guide will take you from zero to a deployed, A2A-compliant agent running on the OpenHive Cloud using our **Source-First** workflow.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (for the CLI and Node.js agents)
- **Python 3.10+** (if building Python agents)
- An OpenHive account (sign up at [openhive.sh](https://openhive.sh))

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Create a New Agent
    The fastest way to start is using `npx`. This scaffolds a new project with all dependencies.

    ```bash
    npx @open-hive/cli create my-first-agent
    ```

    **Interactive Prompts:**
    - **Runtime**: Choose `Node.js (TypeScript)` or `Python`.
    - **Template**: Select `Basic` (simple hello world).

    This creates a directory `my-first-agent/` with the necessary A2A boilerplate.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Start Development Server
    Navigate into your agent's directory and start the local server.

    ```bash
    cd my-first-agent
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    Your agent is now running locally at `http://localhost:4000`.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Chat with your Agent
    Open a new terminal window and use the CLI to chat with your running agent.

    ```bash
    # You can use the global CLI if installed, or npx
    npx @open-hive/cli call http://localhost:4000 --message "Hello OpenHive!"
    ```

    You should see the agent receive the message and respond in real-time.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Deploy to Cloud
    Ready to go live? Log in and publish.

    ```bash
    npx @open-hive/cli login
    npx @open-hive/cli publish
    ```

    The CLI will:
    1. Bundle your source code.
    2. Upload it to the OpenHive Registry.
    3. Return your public **DID** (Decentralized Identifier).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have a live agent on the network.
