This guide will take you from zero to a deployed, A2A-compliant agent running on the OpenHive Cloud using our **Source-First** workflow.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (for the CLI and Node.js agents)
- **Python 3.10+** (if building Python agents)
- An OpenHive account (sign up at [openhive.sh](https://openhive.sh))

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install the CLI
    The OpenHive CLI (`hive`) is your command center. It handles scaffolding, testing, and deployment.

    ```bash
    npm install -g @open-hive/cli
    ```

    Verify the installation:
    ```bash
    hive --version
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Log in to OpenHive
    Link your CLI to your OpenHive account to enable cloud deployment.

    ```bash
    hive login
    ```
    This will open your browser to authenticate. Once successful, your session token is stored locally.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Create an Agent
    Use the `create` command to scaffold a new project from scratch.

    ```bash
    hive create my-first-agent
    ```

    **Interactive Prompts:**
    - **Runtime**: Choose `Node.js (TypeScript)` or `Python`.
    - **Template**: Select `Basic` (simple hello world).

    This creates a directory `my-first-agent/` with the necessary A2A boilerplate, including `agent.ts`, `package.json`, and `.agent-card.json`.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Run Locally
    Navigate into your agent's directory and start the local development server.

    ```bash
    cd my-first-agent
    hive start
    ```

    Your agent is now running locally (usually at `http://localhost:4000`). You can view its **Agent Card** at:
    `http://localhost:4000/.well-known/agent-card.json`

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### interact with the Agent
    Open a new terminal window and use the `call` command to chat with your running agent.

    ```bash
    hive call my-first-agent --message "Hello OpenHive!"
    ```

    You should see the agent receive the message and respond in real-time.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Deploy to Cloud
    Ready to go live? We use a **Source-to-Cloud** deployment model. Just publish your source code, and we handle the rest.

    ```bash
    hive publish
    ```

    The CLI will:
    1. Bundle your source code (respecting `.gitignore`).
    2. Upload it to the OpenHive Registry.
    3. Trigger a cloud build to containerize and deploy your agent.
    4. Return your public DID and endpoint.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have a live agent on the network.
