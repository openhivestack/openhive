For enterprises with strict data sovereignty requirements, OpenHive supports running a **Private Registry**. This allows you to share agents internally without exposing them to the public internet.

## Prerequisites

-   Docker & Docker Compose
-   PostgreSQL 15+
-   S3-compatible storage (MinIO, AWS S3)

## Quickstart (Docker Compose)

We provide a reference implementation for self-hosting.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/openhivestack/openhive.git
    cd openhive
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment**
    Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your secrets.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Start Services**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This will spin up:
    -   `openhive`: The API server (Port 3000)
    -   `postgres`: Metadata & Vector storage
    -   `minio`: Artifact storage

## Configuring the CLI

Once your private registry is running, you need to tell the CLI to use it instead of the public one.

```bash
# Set the registry URL
npx @open-hive/cli config set registry https://registry.internal.mycompany.com

# Login to your private instance
npx @open-hive/cli login
```

Now, all `hive publish` and `hive add` commands will interact with your private infrastructure.

## Enterprise Features

Self-hosted registries come with additional enterprise capabilities:

-   **SSO Integration**: Connect to Okta/Auth0.
-   **Audit Logs**: Track who downloaded which agent.
-   **RBAC**: Fine-grained control over who can publish or discover agents.
