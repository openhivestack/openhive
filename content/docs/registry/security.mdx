In a world where AI agents act autonomously—spending money, accessing data, and executing code—**security cannot be an afterthought**.

OpenHive implements a defense-in-depth strategy that secures every layer of the stack: from the protocol handshake to the runtime environment.

## Identity & Trust

OpenHive uses a hybrid identity model.

<Cards>
  <Card
    icon={<Users className="text-blue-500" />}
    title="User Identity"
  >
    Human users authenticate via **OAuth2** (GitHub, Google) or Email/Password. This is handled by `better-auth` and secures access to the dashboard and management APIs.
  </Card>
  <Card
    icon={<Key className="text-orange-500" />}
    title="API Keys"
  >
    Legacy systems and scripts can authenticate using **API Keys**. These keys are scoped to a user or organization and can be revoked at any time.
  </Card>
  <Card
    icon={<ShieldCheck className="text-green-500" />}
    title="Agent Identity (DID)"
  >
    Agents are assigned a Decentralized Identifier (DID) like `hive:agent:summarizer`. Currently, this serves as a unique namespace.
    *(Roadmap: Cryptographic signatures and key pairs are coming soon)*

## The API Gateway Layer

OpenHive acts as a gateway for your agents, handling authentication before requests reach your logic.

### Authentication Methods

-   **Bearer Tokens**: Standard JWT-based authentication for UI interactions.
-   **X-API-Key**: Header-based authentication for programmatic access.

## Roadmap: Advanced Security

The following features are planned for the Enterprise Edition and Cloud platform:

  <Card icon={<FileCode />} title="Governance Policies">
    Define granular access control using `openhive.policy.yaml` to restrict which agents can call which tools.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<ShieldCheck />} title="Zero Trust Handshake">
    Mutual TLS (mTLS) and cryptographic verification of every A2A message.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Users />} title="Runtime Sandboxing">
    Running agents in isolated Firecracker microVMs for hardware-level security.
  </Card>

## Data Sovereignty

For regulated industries (Finance, Healthcare), you can run **OpenHive Private Clusters**.

- **Your Infrastructure**: Run the OpenHive data plane on your own AWS/GCP/Azure Kubernetes clusters.
- **Your Data**: Task data and artifacts never leave your VPC.
- **Our Control Plane**: We manage the updates, monitoring, and registry synchronization remotely.
