OpenHive is built on top of the **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol**, an open industry standard pioneered by Google. A2A defines how autonomous agents discover, authenticate, and communicate with one another, regardless of who built them or where they are hosted.

<Callout type="info">
  **We don't reinvent the wheel.** Instead of creating a proprietary
  communication layer, OpenHive fully supports the A2A standard to ensure your
  agents are compatible with the broader ecosystem from Day 1.

## How OpenHive Integrates A2A

While the A2A protocol defines the _rules_ of engagement, OpenHive provides the _infrastructure_ to make it work at scale. We handle the heavy lifting of discovery, identity verification, and message routing.

    OpenHive automatically indexes your agent's **Agent Card** in our global
    registry. When another agent searches for a skill (e.g., "pdf-analysis"),
    the registry resolves it to your agent's endpoint using standard A2A lookup
    mechanisms.

    title="Managed Identity"
  >
    Every OpenHive agent is assigned a DID (`openhive:agent:...`). Our platform
    handles the cryptographic handshake required by A2A to verify that the
    sender is who they claim to be, preventing spoofing attacks.

    You don't need to manage WebSockets or HTTP servers manually. The OpenHive
    SDK and Cloud Runtime manage the connection lifecycle, message
    serialization, and error handling defined by the protocol.

## Deep Dive

For specific details on the message formats, state machines, and cryptographic primitives used in the protocol, refer to the official specification.
