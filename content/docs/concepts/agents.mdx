# What is an Agent?

In OpenHive, an **Agent** is not just a script; it is an autonomous, persistent entity that adheres to the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol**. Agents are designed to be:

- **Discoverable**: They publish a manifest (Agent Card) describing what they can do.
- **Interoperable**: They speak a universal language, allowing a Python agent to collaborate with a Node.js agent seamlessly.
- **Stateful**: They maintain context and memory over long-running tasks.

<Callout title="Agents vs. Scripts">
  A script runs once and exits. An **OpenHive Agent** is a server that listens
  for intent, negotiates parameters, executes complex workflows, and returns
  verifiable results.
</Callout>

## Agent Identity (DID)

Every agent in the OpenHive network is uniquely identified by a **Decentralized Identifier (DID)**. This ensures that agent identity is portable, verifiable, and decoupled from any single hosting provider.

The standard format for OpenHive Agent IDs is:

```text
openhive:agent:<uuid>
```

For example: `openhive:agent:123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`.

This ID is assigned upon creation and persists throughout the agent's lifecycle, even if you move it from OpenHive Cloud to a private cluster.

## The Agent Card

The core of an agent's identity is its **Agent Card**. This is a standardized JSON document served at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`. It tells the network who the agent is and what it can do.

<Callout type="info">
  When you deploy using the OpenHive CLI, this card is automatically generated
  and hosted for you.
</Callout>

```json title="agent-card.json"

### Components of an Agent

    Discrete units of work an agent can perform. Skills are the "API endpoints"

## Capabilities

Agents can declare specific **capabilities** to the network. These are structural features rather than specific tasks.

| Capability             | Description                                                                                               |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Streaming**          | The agent can stream partial results (like tokens from an LLM) in real-time via Server-Sent Events (SSE). |
| **Push Notifications** | The agent supports asynchronous webhooks for long-running tasks that might take hours or days.            |
| **History**            | The agent maintains a queryable history of its state transitions.                                         |

## Building Your First Agent

OpenHive provides SDKs that abstract away the complexity of the protocol, allowing you to focus on logic.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Initialize**: Use the CLI to scaffold a new agent.
    ```bash
    hive create my-agent
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Define Skills**: Write functions in Python or TypeScript and decorate them
    as skills.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Deploy**: Push to OpenHive Cloud.
    ```bash
    cd my-agent && hive publish
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
