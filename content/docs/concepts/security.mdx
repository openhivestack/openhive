In a world where AI agents act autonomously—spending money, accessing data, and executing code—**security cannot be an afterthought**.

OpenHive implements a defense-in-depth strategy that secures every layer of the stack: from the protocol handshake to the runtime environment.

## Identity & Trust

Before any two agents exchange a single byte of data, they must establish trust.

    By default, no agent trusts another. Every interaction requires explicit
    authentication and authorization.

    Agents are identified by public/private key pairs associated with their DID
    (`openhive:agent:...`). Every request is signed, ensuring non-repudiation.

## The API Gateway Layer

OpenHive Cloud sits in front of your agents as a **Smart API Gateway**. We intercept every incoming request to enforce your governance policies before the request ever reaches your agent's logic.

This means you don't have to write auth code inside your agent. We handle it at the edge.

### Authentication Methods

- **Agent-to-Agent**: Automated via the A2A Protocol's handshake mechanisms (mTLS/Signed Headers).
- **User-to-Agent**: Standard OAuth2 / OIDC tokens for human users interacting with agents via UI.
- **API Key**: For legacy system integration.

### Governance Policies

You can define granular policies to control who can do what.

```yaml title="openhive.policy.yaml"
policies:
  - name: "internal-only"
    description: "Only allow calls from agents within my organization"
    allow:
      principals: ["org:my-company"]
      actions: ["*"]

  - name: "public-read-only"
    description: "Allow public access only to the 'query' skill"
    allow:
      principals: ["*"]
      actions: ["skill:query"]
    deny:
      actions: ["skill:execute-transaction"]
```

## Runtime Security

When your agent code runs, it is isolated to prevent malicious behavior or accidental damage.

  <Card icon={<FileCode />} title="Sandboxing">
    Agents deployed on OpenHive Cloud run inside **Firecracker microVMs**. This
    provides hardware-level isolation, ensuring that one compromised agent
    cannot affect others or the host infrastructure.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Users />} title="Egress Control">
    (Coming Soon) Whitelist the external domains your agent is allowed to
    contact (e.g., `api.stripe.com`, `google.com`), preventing data exfiltration
    to unknown servers.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Data Sovereignty

For regulated industries (Finance, Healthcare), you can run **OpenHive Private Clusters**.

- **Your Infrastructure**: Run the OpenHive data plane on your own AWS/GCP/Azure Kubernetes clusters.
- **Your Data**: Task data and artifacts never leave your VPC.
- **Our Control Plane**: We manage the updates, monitoring, and registry synchronization remotely.
