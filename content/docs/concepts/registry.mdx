**OpenHive Registry** is the central nervous system of the agentic web. It serves two critical functions:
1.  **Discovery**: Like DNS, it resolves semantic intent (e.g., "I need to summarize a PDF") to an addressable agent endpoint.
2.  **Distribution**: Like NPM or Shadcn, it hosts the source code and templates for agents, enabling the "Source Scaffolding" workflow.

## Core Functions

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<Box className="text-purple-500" />} title="Source Distribution">
    The registry acts as a repository for agent source code. When you run `hive add`, you are downloading a verified template directly into your codebase.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Globe className="text-blue-500" />} title="Global Discovery">
    A centralized index of all public agents deployed on OpenHive Cloud. Agents
    are indexed by their capabilities, skills, and descriptions.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Search className="text-orange-500" />} title="Semantic Search">
    Powered by vector embeddings, the registry supports natural language
    queries. You don't need to know an agent's exact name—just describe what you
    need.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Lock className="text-red-500" />} title="Private Sub-Registries">
    Organizations can run isolated registry instances. These allow internal agents to discover each other while remaining invisible to the public web.

## Source Scaffolding Model

OpenHive follows a **"Source-First"** philosophy. We believe that for AI agents to be reliable, developers must own the code.

When you run:
```bash
hive add news-summarizer
```

The CLI:
1. Queries the registry for `news-summarizer`.
2. Downloads the source files (TypeScript/Python).
3. Scaffolds them into your project (e.g., `src/agents/news-summarizer`).
4. Installs dependencies.

This allows you to:
- **Inspect** exactly what the agent does.
- **Modify** the prompt engineering or logic.
- **Extend** the agent with new tools or APIs.

## Runtime Discovery

At runtime, agents can query the registry to find peers to collaborate with.

### Semantic Search
The most common pattern is to let the registry find the best match for a task.

```typescript
// "I need an agent that can summarize legal documents"
const agents = await registry.search("summarize legal PDF contracts");
```

### Structured Filtering
For precise control, you can use structured filters.

| Filter | Syntax | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Skill** | `skill:chat` | Find agents that implement a specific skill ID. |
| **Tag** | `tag:official` | Filter by tags (e.g., verified agents). |
| **Name** | `name:"Weather Bot"` | Exact name match. |
| **Owner** | `owner:@google` | Find agents published by a specific user or org. |

```typescript
// Find a chat agent that is also tagged as 'finance'
const agents = await registry.search("skill:chat tag:finance");
```

## Registration Process

Registration is automated via the CLI.

1.  **Push (`hive push`)**: The CLI bundles your source code (tarball) and uploads it to the registry. This makes the *source* available for others to scaffold (if public).
2.  **Deploy (`hive deploy`)**: The platform builds a container from your source and deploys it. The *running instance* is then indexed for runtime discovery.

### Data Model

Each entry in the registry corresponds to an **Agent Version**. This ensures immutability.

```typescript
type RegistryEntry = {
  did: string; // openhive:agent:uuid
  name: string; // unique-handle
  version: string; // semver (1.0.0)
  endpoint: string; // https://...
  skills: Skill[]; // List of capabilities
  sourceUrl?: string; // Link to download source tarball
  stats: {
    usage: number; // Popularity metric
    downloads: number; // Scaffolding count
  };
};
```
