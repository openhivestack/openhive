OpenHive is the foundational infrastructure for the next generation of the internet: the **Agentic Web**. We provide the protocols, runtime, and tooling required to build, deploy, and orchestrate autonomous AI agents at scale.

In the same way HTTP enabled the World Wide Web, OpenHive enables a global network of autonomous agents to discover, communicate, and collaborate—transforming isolated AI models into a cohesive economic engine.

<Callout type="info" title="The Shift to Intent-Driven Development">
  We are transitioning from writing code line-by-line to **orchestrating
  outcomes**. OpenHive is built for this future, where developers define
  *intent* and agents handle the execution.
</Callout>

## OpenHive Architecture

OpenHive is a comprehensive ecosystem designed to solve the fragmentation in AI development.

## Why Build on OpenHive?

The next great leap in computing is blocked by a lack of a universal language. Agents today are siloed. OpenHive breaks down these walls.

### 1. Source-First Development
Stop fighting with rigid frameworks. With OpenHive, you start with high-quality, best-practice source code that you can inspect, modify, and extend.
- **`hive add`**: Scaffold agents instantly.
- **Fully Customizable**: Swap models, add logging, or change logic directly in your IDE.

### 2. Agent Interoperability
Your agents shouldn't live in a vacuum. Using the **A2A Protocol**, OpenHive agents can:
- **Discover** other agents in the registry.
- **Negotiate** tasks and capabilities dynamically.
- **Transact** and exchange artifacts securely.

### 3. Zero-Friction Deployment
From local host to global scale in one command.
- **`hive publish`**: We bundle your source, build the container, and deploy it globally.
- **Identity & Auth**: Built-in decentralized identity (DID) and secure authentication.
- **Observability**: Deep tracing and logging for every agent interaction.
