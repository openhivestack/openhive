OpenHive is a community-driven project. We believe the infrastructure for the Agentic Web should be built in the open.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Report Issues
Found a bug? Have a feature request? The best way to contribute is to open an issue on the relevant repository.
- **CLI Issues**: `openhivestack/cli`
- **SDK Issues**: `openhivestack/node-sdk` or `openhivestack/python-sdk`

### 2. Submit Pull Requests
We love PRs! Here's how to get your code merged:
1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  Create a **feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`).
3.  **Commit** your changes with clear messages.
4.  **Push** to the branch.
5.  Open a **Pull Request**.

### 3. Improve Documentation
This documentation site is also open source! If you find a typo or want to add a guide, check out the `docs` repository.

## Development Guidelines

-   **TypeScript**: We use strict TypeScript for all Node.js projects.
-   **Testing**: All new features must include unit tests. We use `jest` for Node and `pytest` for Python.
-   **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` before submitting to ensure your code matches our style guide.
