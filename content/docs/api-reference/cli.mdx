import { Terminal } from 'lucide-react';

The `@open-hive/cli` is the unified command-line interface for the OpenHive platform. It streamlines the entire agent development lifecycle—from scaffolding a new project to deploying it to a production cluster.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @open-hive/cli
```

## Core Workflow

### Initialization & Creation

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `hive init` | Initialize a new OpenHive project configuration (`hive.json`) in the current directory. Defines where agents are stored and which runtime (Node/Python) to use. |
| `hive create <name>` | **(For Creators)** Scaffold a brand new agent project from scratch. Use this if you are building a new agent to publish to the registry. |
| `hive add <agent>` | **(For Integrators)** Download and scaffold an existing agent from the registry into your project. You own the source code. |

### Development

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `hive start` | Starts the agent(s) in the current directory in development mode. |
| `hive call <agent>` | Interactive chat interface to test and message any running agent using the A2A protocol. Supports streaming responses. |

### Deployment & Publishing

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `hive login` | Authenticates your session with OpenHive Cloud. |
| `hive publish` | **Source-to-Cloud Deployment**. Bundles your agent's source code, uploads it to the registry, and triggers a cloud deployment. |
| `hive push` | Uploads and registers your agent's source code to the registry without deploying. |
| `hive deploy` | Deploys a specific version of an already-pushed agent to the OpenHive Cloud runtime. |

### Utility

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `hive config set <key> <val>` | Set global configuration (e.g., `registry_url`). |
| `hive whoami` | Show the currently logged-in user and active organization. |
| `hive uninstall <agent>` | Remove an agent from your project. |

## Command Details

### `hive init`

Initializes the `hive.json` configuration file. This file tells the CLI how to handle your project structure.

```bash
hive init
```

**Options:**
- `--yes`, `-y`: Skip prompts and use defaults.

### `hive add`

Scaffolds an agent from the OpenHive Registry into your project.

```bash
hive add news-summarizer
```

This will:
1. Fetch the source code for `news-summarizer`.
2. Place it in your configured agents directory (e.g., `src/agents/news-summarizer`).
3. Install necessary dependencies.

### `hive call`

Interact with your agents via the command line.

```bash
hive call my-agent --message "Summarize the latest tech news"
```

**Options:**
- `--stream`, `-s`: Stream the response (default: true).
- `--debug`, `-d`: Show verbose debug information.

### `hive publish`

The primary command for deploying your work. It follows the **Source-First** philosophy.

```bash
hive publish
```

This command performs two steps:
1. **Push**: Bundles your source code (respecting `.gitignore`) and uploads it to the OpenHive Registry.
2. **Deploy**: Triggers the OpenHive Cloud to build and run your agent container.

**Options:**
- `--public`: Make the agent publicly discoverable (default: true).
- `--force`: Force redeployment of an existing version.
